Hi everyone, I am Peya Mowar, and I am 
presenting our work “Breaking the News Barrier:

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.600
Towards Understanding News Consumption 
Practices among BVI Individuals in India”.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.560
This work was done with Meghna Gupta and Mohit 
Jain, who are my amazing colleagues at Microsoft

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.240
Research India. Researchers actively study news 
consumption practices among different countries,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.280
to analyze their information needs and gauge their 
civic engagement. Prior research has highlighted

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.560
the struggles of BVI individuals in staying 
updated with current news events. And as digital

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.160
news access and personalized news discovery become 
more prevalent, the preferences and methods of

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:52.760
news consumption among BVI individuals, who are 
notably early adopters of AI, have evolved. There

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.400
remains a gap in understanding the current digital 
news consumption behaviors of BVI individuals,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.880
particularly in Global Southern countries like 
India. India is also home to the largest BVI

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.680
population worldwide, with approximately 4.95 
million blind and 35 million visually impaired

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.600
citizens. Still, the enforcement of the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities Act often falls short,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.000
leading to persistent accessibility barriers 
on numerous websites. India is home to a young

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.640
and linguistically diverse population, with 729 
million people in India who consume news actively

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.920
in Indian languages. Indian news users with 
internet access are embracing a mobile-first,

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.440
platform-dominated media environment with 
search engines, social media, and messaging

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:51.760
applications playing a key role in how people 
access news in a setting characterized by low

00:01:51.760 --> 00:02:00.000
trust and widespread worries about different 
kinds of disinformation. In this study, we

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.680
ask three research questions. What drives news 
consumption preferences among BVI individuals

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.280
in India? What methods and infrastructure do BVI 
individuals currently use for interacting with

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.920
news sources? And what are the primary barriers 
that they encounter in accessing digital news and

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:25.000
their workarounds? We recruited 17 participants 
who consumed news in a variety of languages,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
with 11 participants consuming news in more than 1 
language. We reached out to our participants using

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.440
Zoom or Microsoft Teams. We asked them to share 
their screen and consume news using their phone,

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.000
laptop or tablet. And this session was followed 
by semi-structured interviews around their news

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.720
consumption practices. All of this data was 
analyzed qualitatively using thematic analysis.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.120
Most of our participants claimed their drive to 
consume news stemmed from an urge to participate

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.720
in meaningful conversations. Our participants 
also leaned heavily on the knowledge they acquired

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.080
while consuming news to help them achieve their 
learning objectives and advance their careers.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.480
On this slide we also have an image depicting 
their preferences for devices, media platforms,

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:23.280
and publishing brands. More details are discussed 
in the paper. Our participants consumed news in

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.800
two ways, by reading and listening. We observed 
that our participants preferred text-based

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.560
modalities such as apps, website articles and 
aggregators when they wanted to engage actively

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.280
with news. On the other hand, they liked the 
simple navigation offered by audio modalities

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:48.600
such as Google Assistant or Youtube when they were 
engaging passively or multitasking. Additionally,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.840
we found that source accessibility was not 
the predominant consideration for selecting

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.720
news sources among our participants. Rather, 
other news quality attributes such as trust,

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.600
coverage, and neutrality took precedence in 
shaping their consumption practices. Participants

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.560
often forwent accessibility requirements to gain 
access to topics that held specific interest for

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.120
them. Our participants encountered numerous 
operational barriers, when accessing news on

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.480
digital platforms. The most significant challenge 
was the overwhelming presence of ads and popups,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:33.960
paywalls and other kinds of dynamic and cluttered 
content. Our participants often relied on human

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.640
infrastructure to overcome these barriers, 
such as by reading news from volunteer-driven

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:45.680
e-newspapers. They often downloaded additional 
apps such as OCR or ad blockers for assisting

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.320
them in accessing news. And some participants 
switched to alternatives such as subscribing to

00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:00.520
RSS feeds or interacting with voice assistants for 
getting access to news. The most profound impact

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.560
of the barriers I mentioned before was a lag in 
information access. Our participants reported

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:13.360
delays in receiving news, which often resulted in 
missed opportunities. Our participants also felt

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.840
compelled to stick to known sources, which limited 
their exposure to diverse viewpoints. And finally,

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.960
they repeatedly expressed sentiments of isolation 
and neglect, emphasizing a lack of empathy amongst

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:33.040
news agencies. So, in this work, we found 
that the news consumption patterns in the

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:39.360
BVI community diverged from broader trends 
with current access to news being, at best,

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:46.320
patchy. More details and discussions can be found 
in the paper. Thank you so much for listening.
