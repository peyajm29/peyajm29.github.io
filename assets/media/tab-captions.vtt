Hi everyone, I am Peya Mowar, and I am 
presenting our work “Tab to Autocomplete:

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.160
The Effects of AI Coding 
Assistants on Web Accessibility”.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.760
There are many efforts like guidelines, training,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.160
and tools designed to promote web 
accessibility among developers. However,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.360
getting them to produce the accessible 
(web) UI code still remains a challenge.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.960
This is because the success of these efforts 
ultimately depends on developers' conscious

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:39.200
efforts to engage with them i.e., they require 
developers to still care about accessibility.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.680
And so while accessibility developer tools are 
rarely adopted; today, developers are frequently

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.880
adopting AI coding assistants, that represent 
a significant breakthrough in programming.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:58.320
The workflow of AI-assisted development today 
looks somewhat like this: Developers use these

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.560
assistants to produce UI code, which is rendered 
as a web UI and accessed by different users.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.000
And so we might presume that since these 
developers are using AI assistants,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.440
if those assistants started 
producing accessible code,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.680
then the UIs that developers would 
create would be more accessible.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.520
Several aspects of this line 
of reasoning have been unclear.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.160
First, it is unclear whether these AI 
coding assistants can produce accessible

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.160
code and have been trained to do so.
Secondly, we also don't know the developer

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.640
accessibility expertise required to 
effectively use these assistants.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.880
To investigate these issues, we ran a 
study in which 16 developers untrained

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.800
in accessibility were tasked with building 
web components with an AI coding assistant.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.680
The use of AI coding assistants has shown mixed 
results in resolving some common accessibility

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.160
issues such as adding alternative text or 
maintaining appropriate colour contrast.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.200
We observed that AI coding assistants 
can actually produce accessible code,

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.080
but developers still need accessibility 
expertise to make use of them effectively.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.080
These results suggest that future work could 
usefully engage with how to make AI coding

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.800
assistants better at producing accessible code 
and how to reduce the developer awareness and

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.840
expertise required to benefit from 
the accessibility coding assistance.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.720
